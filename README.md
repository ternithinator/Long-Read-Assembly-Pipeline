# Long-Read-Assembly-Pipeline
Trying to build a pipeline for long read de-novo genome assembly primarily using PacBio Data. I will go through multiple whole genome assembly pipelines performed by different groups to learn and understand the steps and tools involoved. All the papers which I refer shall be listed. I will try to make multiple pipelines - only using PacBio hifi reads and HiC data and also a hybrid assembly pipelines using hifi reads plus illumina data.

-> Dataset that I am have first downloaded is from the paper "A complete reference genome assembly and annotation of the Black Redstart Phoenicurus ochruros" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.21.655187). I am using th PacBio hifi reads available as part of this project to learn and test various tools. Also referring the github page which details assembly pipeline.
(https://github.com/Prashantevo/Black_redstart_genome_assembly, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28912433, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JBLKNL000000000).

Below I will also list some other papers which I have selected. Different tools are used in each papers, assembly methods are also different. I will be trying to learn and test different tools and methods listed there and also trying to compare my results with them to make sure things are running smoothly.
